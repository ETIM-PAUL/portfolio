This Restaurant Ordering Application has many features, such as allowing you sign up, as a restaurant owner, to manage your restaurant orders and reservations. It also allows you to sign up as a customer, so that you can place orders from your favourite restaurants. View restaurant locations and track the status for the delivery of your orders.",
